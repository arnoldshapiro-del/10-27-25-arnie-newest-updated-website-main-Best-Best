<analysis>**original_problem_statement**: The user's goal is a massive content expansion of their psychiatric practice website. This involves creating multiple new, detailed, SEO-optimized landing pages for various conditions the practice treats. The process follows a consistent two-prompt pattern: the user requests a new page with a specific structure (Prompt 1), the agent builds the placeholder page, and then the user provides the final, detailed content for the agent to populate (Prompt 2).

In this session, the agent's work involved:
1.  Populating the  page with full clinical content, fixing linting issues, and verifying its display.
2.  Creating a new structured placeholder page for  based on detailed specifications.
3.  Populating the  page with full clinical content provided by the user.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The project is a React SPA (Vite, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui). The website has a suite of comprehensive, templated landing pages for various mental health conditions.
-   Fully populated and verified pages exist for: ADHD, Anxiety, Depression, Insomnia, Autism, OCD, Seasonal Affective Disorder, Social Anxiety, Bipolar Disorder, and Trichotillomania.
-   A new page for Postpartum Depression () has been created and populated with full clinical content, but it is not yet linted or verified.
-   The main navigation page () and  have been updated to include links to all created pages.

**Last working item**:
-   Last item agent was working: Populating the new  page with the complete clinical content provided by the user in Prompt 2. The agent used the  tool to overwrite the placeholder file with the new content.
-   Status: IN PROGRESS
-   Agent Testing Done: N
-   Which testing method agent to use? The next steps are to run the linter (), fix any errors (likely unescaped characters), and then use the  tool to visually verify the page content and layout.
-   User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1: Linting errors in  (P0)**
    -   **Description**: After populating the file with raw content from the user, it is highly likely to contain linting errors, primarily unescaped characters (apostrophes, quotes) in JSX, similar to what occurred with the  page.
    -   **Status**: NOT STARTED
    -   **Next debug checklist**:
        1.  Run  on .
        2.  Identify all  errors.
        3.  Use the  tool to replace problematic characters with their HTML entities (e.g.,  with  or ).
        4.  Re-run the linter to confirm all issues are resolved.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: The app will not build or render correctly with linting errors. Fixing them is necessary to complete the page creation task.
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend (visual verification).

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1: Finalize and Verify the Postpartum Depression Page (P0)**
    -   **Where to resume**: The content has been written to . The next command should be to run the linter.
    -   **What will be achieved with this?**: A complete, verified, and functional new landing page for Postpartum Depression, integrated into the site's navigation.
    -   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend.
    -   **Blocked on something**: Issue 1 (Linting errors).

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Upcoming Tasks:**
    -   Await next user Prompt 1 for a new condition page or other instructions.
-   **Future Tasks:**
    -   **P1: Deprecate Legacy Assessments:** Plan and execute the redirection of all legacy HTML assessment URLs (e.g., ) to the modern React page ().
    -   **P2: Refactor :** This monolithic 5000+ line file needs to be broken down into smaller, manageable components. The assessment data should be extracted into a separate data file (JSON or TS).
    -   **P3: Remove Unused Supabase Code:** The files under  are unused and should be deleted to clean up the codebase.

**Completed work in this session**
-   **Trichotillomania Page (Full Implementation):**
    -   Populated the placeholder page at  with full user-provided content.
    -   Fixed 36+ linting errors, including unescaped entities and TypeScript type issues.
    -   Performed multiple visual verifications using the  tool to confirm all sections rendered correctly.
-   **Postpartum Depression Page (Structure):**
    -   Created a new placeholder page at  based on user specifications.
    -   Added the  route to .
    -   Added a navigation card to .
    -   Updated  with the new URL.
-   **Postpartum Depression Page (Content Population):**
    -   Populated  with the full clinical content provided by the user.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   **Issue 1: Monolithic  file:** Identified as needing refactoring but not prioritized by the user.
-   **Issue 2: Legacy Assessment System:** The duplicate HTML assessment files in  remain, creating technical debt.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   N/A

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend:** React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui.
-   **Content Workflow:** A clear two-prompt system (Prompt 1: Structure, Prompt 2: Content) is used for creating new pages.
-   **Linting & Error Correction:** Using ESLint to identify and fix code quality issues, particularly  in JSX content.
-   **UI Verification:** Using the  tool to visually confirm that pages render correctly after content updates.

**key DB schema**
-   N/A (Frontend only project)

**changes in tech stack**
-   None.

**All files of reference**
-   : The primary file being worked on. Created and populated, now requires linting and verification.
-   : The most recently completed page. Can be used as a reference for fixing linting issues.
-   : Updated with the route for .
-   : Updated with a navigation card for the Postpartum Depression page.
-   : Updated with the URL for the new page.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   : Over 5000 lines, needs to be broken into smaller components.
-   : The entire legacy HTML assessment system should be deprecated and removed.

**key api endpoints**
-   N/A

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   Your immediate task is to finalize the  page.
-   **Step 1:** Run  on .
-   **Step 2:** You will likely encounter many  errors. Fix these by replacing characters like  with . Refer to the fixes made in  during this session for examples.
-   **Step 3:** Once all linting errors are resolved, use the  tool to visually verify that the page renders correctly. Check the hero section, a mid-page section (like the medication table), and the footer.
-   After verifying the page, summarize your work and await the user's next instruction. Do not start on future tasks unless explicitly told to.
