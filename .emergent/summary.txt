<analysis>**original_problem_statement**: The user's goal is a massive content expansion of their psychiatric practice website. This involves creating multiple new, detailed, SEO-optimized landing pages for various conditions the practice treats. The process follows a consistent pattern: the user requests a new page with a specific structure (Prompt 1), the agent builds the placeholder page, and then the user provides the final, detailed content for the agent to populate (Prompt 2).

In this session, the user requested the creation and/or population of several pages:
1.  Verify the content of the  page.
2.  Create and populate a new page for .
3.  Verify the content of the  page.
4.  Create and populate a new page for .
5.  Create a structured placeholder page for  (Hair Pulling Disorder).

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The project is a React SPA (Vite, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui). The website has a suite of comprehensive, templated landing pages for various mental health conditions.
- Fully populated and verified pages exist for: ADHD, Anxiety, Depression, Insomnia, Autism, OCD, Seasonal Affective Disorder, Social Anxiety, and Bipolar Disorder.
- A placeholder page (with structured but placeholder content) now exists for Trichotillomania.
- The main navigation page () and  have been updated to include links to all these new pages.

**Last working item**:
- Last item agent was working: Creating the structured placeholder page for Trichotillomania () as per the user's detailed specifications (Prompt 1). This involved creating the new page file, adding the route to , adding a navigation card to , and updating .
- Status: USER VERIFICATION PENDING (Agent's task is complete; waiting for the user to provide the full content for the page).
- Agent Testing Done: Y
- Which testing method agent to use? NA (The next step is for the user to provide content. After that, the agent will populate the page and use the  tool for verification).
- User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- There are no known bugs or technical issues.

**In progress Task List**:
- There are no tasks currently in progress. The agent is awaiting user input.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks:**
    - **P0: Populate Trichotillomania Page:** The user has provided the structure for the  page. The agent should expect a second prompt with the final, detailed clinical content to populate this page.
- **Future Tasks:**
    - **P1: Deprecate Legacy Assessments:** Plan and execute the redirection of all legacy HTML assessment URLs (e.g., ) to the modern React page () to reduce technical debt.
    - **P2: Refactor :** This monolithic 5000+ line file needs to be broken down into smaller, manageable components. The assessment data itself should be extracted into a separate data file (JSON or TS).
    - **P3: Remove Unused Supabase Code:** The files under  are unused and should be deleted to clean up the codebase.

**Completed work in this session**
- **OCD Page:** Verified that the comprehensive content provided by the user in a previous session was correctly implemented.
- **Social Anxiety Disorder Page:** Created the placeholder structure and then fully populated the  page with detailed, user-provided content.
- **Seasonal Affective Disorder Page:** Verified that the page already contained comprehensive clinical content, likely from a previous session.
- **Bipolar Disorder Page:** Created the placeholder structure and then fully populated the  page with detailed, user-provided content.
- **Trichotillomania Page (Structure):** Created a complete placeholder page structure at , including all section templates, navigation links, and sitemap updates. Awaiting final content from the user.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
   - **Issue 1: Monolithic  file:** This large file was identified as needing refactoring but has not been addressed as it wasn't prioritized by the user.
   - **Issue 2: Legacy Assessment System:** The duplicate HTML assessment files in  remain active, creating technical debt.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
  - N/A

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend:** React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui.
-   **Component-Based Architecture:** Using a templating approach by copying and modifying existing page components to rapidly create new, consistent landing pages.
-   **Content Management Workflow:** A clear, two-prompt system (Prompt 1: Structure, Prompt 2: Content) is used for creating new pages.

**key DB schema**
  - N/A (Frontend only project)

**changes in tech stack**
  - None.

**All files of reference**
-   : The primary file from the last working item. Created with a placeholder structure.
-   : Created and fully populated in this session.
-   : Created and fully populated in this session.
-   : Updated with routes for , , and .
-   : Updated with navigation cards for the new condition pages.
-   : Updated with URLs for the new pages.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   : Over 5000 lines, needs to be broken into smaller components.
-   : The entire legacy HTML assessment system should be deprecated and removed.

**key api endpoints**
- N/A

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- Your immediate task is to wait for the user to provide the detailed clinical content for the  page.
- The user follows a very consistent two-prompt workflow. Once they provide the content (Prompt 2), your job will be to overwrite the placeholder file (), run the linter, and use the  tool to verify that all content sections are displaying correctly.
- Do not proceed with other tasks unless instructed. The user is driving the content creation process.

**documents and test reports created in this job**
- None.
