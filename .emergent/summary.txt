<analysis>**original_problem_statement**: The user's goal is a massive content expansion of their psychiatric practice website. This involves creating multiple new, detailed, SEO-optimized landing pages for various conditions the practice treats. The process follows a consistent pattern: the user requests a new page with a specific structure, the agent builds the placeholder page, and then the user provides the final, detailed content for the agent to populate.

The most recent requests were:
1.  Create and populate a new page for Insomnia ().
2.  Create and populate a new page for Autism Spectrum Disorder ().
3.  Create a placeholder page for Seasonal Affective Disorder ().
4.  Create a placeholder page for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder ().
5.  Populate the newly created OCD page with comprehensive, patient-friendly content.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Upcoming Tasks:**
    -   **P0: Populate Seasonal Affective Disorder Page:** The user has created the structure for the  page but has not yet provided the final content. The agent should expect this content soon.
-   **Future Tasks:**
    -   **P1: Deprecate Legacy Assessments:** Plan and execute the redirection of all legacy HTML assessment URLs (e.g., ) to the modern React page () to reduce technical debt.
    -   **P2: Refactor :** This monolithic 5000+ line file needs to be broken down into smaller, manageable components. The assessment data itself should be extracted into a separate data file (JSON or TS).
    -   **P3: Remove Unused Supabase Code:** The files under  are unused and should be deleted to clean up the codebase.

-   **Issue 2: Legacy Assessment System:** The duplicate HTML assessment files in  remain active, creating technical debt and a potential source of confusion.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   N/A

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend:** React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui.
-   **Component-Based Architecture:** The agent is effectively using a templating approach, copying and modifying existing page components to rapidly create new, consistent landing pages.
-   **Content Management:** The core task involves managing and inserting large blocks of text, lists, and structured data into React components.

**key DB schema**
-   N/A (All work is frontend only)

**changes in tech stack**
-   None.

**All files of reference**
-   : The primary file being worked on. It was created with placeholder content and then overwritten with the user's final content.
-   : Created and populated in this session.
-   : Created in this session.
-   : Updated with routes for , , and .
-   : Updated with navigation cards and links for the new condition pages.
-   : Updated with URLs for the new pages.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   : This is the most critical area for refactoring. It's over 5000 lines and difficult to maintain.
-   : The entire legacy HTML assessment system should be deprecated and removed.

**key api endpoints**
-   N/A

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   Your immediate task is to finalize the OCD page. Run the linter on  to fix any formatting issues, then use the screenshot tool to verify all content sections are displaying correctly.
-   The user is adding a large volume of content by creating new condition pages. Be prepared for the next request, which will likely be to populate the  page or create another new condition page entirely.
-   The workflow is well-established: create structure -> add navigation -> get content from user -> populate page -> verify. Stick to this pattern.

**documents and test reports created in this job**
-   None.
