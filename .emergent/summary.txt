<analysis>**original_problem_statement**: The user's primary goal is a significant content expansion of their psychiatric practice's website. This is achieved through a consistent two-prompt workflow: Prompt 1 details the structure for a new condition-specific landing page, which the agent builds as a placeholder. Prompt 2 provides the full clinical content for the agent to populate the page.

In this session, the agent performed the following major tasks:
1.  Finalized the  page by fixing linting errors and verifying its functionality.
2.  Created and fully populated the  page.
3.  Implemented a complex, multi-part user request to add a Conditions We Treat dropdown menu to the main navigation, including fixing hover behavior and making it responsive.
4.  Executed a three-part global content cleanup across all 12 condition pages, which involved:
    *   Removing specific marketing claims (e.g., 9,000+ patients treated).
    *   Correcting factual information (e.g., changing 40 years of experience to 35+ years, fixing a wrong phone number).
    *   Removing non-compliant sections (e.g., Crisis Text Line information).
5.  Started the creation of a new landing page for  by building the placeholder structure as per the user's Prompt 1.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The project is a React SPA built with Vite, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui. The website features a comprehensive navigation system with a dynamic dropdown menu and a main  index page.
- There are **12 fully implemented and verified condition pages**, which have undergone significant content cleanup in this session.
- A **new placeholder page for Childhood Bipolar Disorder** has been created at .
- The new page is already integrated into the site's routing (), navigation data (), the main disorders list (), and the .

**Last working item**:
-   Last item agent was working: Fulfilling Prompt 1 from the user to create a new placeholder landing page for **Childhood Bipolar Disorder**. The agent created the file, added the route in , updated the navigation data in , added a card to , and updated .
-   Status: IN PROGRESS
-   Agent Testing Done: N
-   Which testing method agent to use? frontend testing agent. The agent must first run the linter (), then build the project (), and finally use the testing agent to verify that the placeholder page loads correctly at the  route.
-   User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1: Verify the new  placeholder page (P0)**
    -   **Description**: The agent created the page and updated all related files but did not perform any verification steps. There could be syntax errors, routing issues, or other problems preventing the page from loading correctly.
    -   **Status**: NOT STARTED
    -   **Next debug checklist**:
        1.  Run  on  and fix any reported errors.
        2.  Run  to ensure the entire project compiles successfully.
        3.  Use the  to access the  URL and confirm that the placeholder page loads without errors.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: This confirms that the structural setup for the new page is complete and error-free before the user provides the final content.
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend.

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1: Complete the Childhood Bipolar Disorder page (P0)**
    -   **Where to resume**: The placeholder page has been created. After the verification step (Issue 1) is complete, the agent must wait for the user to provide Prompt 2 containing the full clinical content.
    -   **What will be achieved with this?**: A new, complete, and verified landing page for Childhood Bipolar Disorder, fully integrated into the website.
    -   **Status**: BLOCKED
    -   **Blocked on something**: The user needs to provide the clinical content (Prompt 2).

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Upcoming Tasks:**
    -   **P0: Populate :** Await Prompt 2 from the user and populate the page with clinical content.
    -   **P1: Create  page:** The user has indicated this will be the next page to create. Await Prompt 1 for this.
-   **Future Tasks:**
    -   **P2: Deprecate Legacy Assessments:** Plan and execute the redirection of all legacy HTML assessment URLs (e.g., ) to the modern React page ().
    -   **P3: Refactor :** This monolithic 5000+ line file needs to be broken down into smaller, manageable components. Assessment data should be extracted.
    -   **P4: Remove Unused Supabase Code:** The files under  are unused and should be deleted to clean up the codebase.

**Completed work in this session**
-   **Postpartum Depression Page:** Finalized and verified.
-   **DMDD Page:** Created structure, populated with full clinical content, and verified.
-   **Navigation Dropdown Menu:** Implemented a new data-driven, hover-based dropdown for Conditions We Treat in the header, including fixing hover-intent bugs and updating all condition display names. Removed the redundant View All Conditions link.
-   **Global Content Cleanup (Site-wide):**

-   **Childhood Bipolar Disorder Page:** Created the placeholder structure and integrated it into routing and navigation.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   **Issue 1: Monolithic  file:** Identified as needing refactoring but not yet prioritized by the user.
-   **Issue 2: Legacy Assessment System:** The duplicate HTML assessment files in  remain, creating technical debt.
-   **Issue 3: Unused Supabase Code:** The  directory still exists and should be removed.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   N/A

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Data-Driven UI:** Using a central data array in  to dynamically generate the navigation dropdown, making future additions easy.
-   **Complex UI State:** Managing hover states with timeouts in React to create a user-friendly dropdown menu that correctly handles mouse intent.
-   **Global Search & Replace:** Using shell commands (, ) and targeted file edits to perform site-wide content corrections efficiently.
-   **Systematic Content Auditing:** Carefully reviewing and modifying content across more than a dozen files based on specific user requirements for compliance and accuracy.
